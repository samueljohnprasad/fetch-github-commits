I have no hesitation in recommending R, Sai Aniketh who has expressed a deep desire to seek knowledge and pursue his Master's in Computer Science in your revered university. In the final semester of his graduation, I got to know Aniketh being his Major Project Internal guide.
As I was his project advisor and evaluator, I had initially engaged him in in several courses and we had related discussions regarding bis project. He first approached me for his Handwriting Recognition project. Under my supervision while working on this project he learnt image processing and computer vision. He has contacted me on several occasions for guidance and has
a pragmatic approach to rectify problems. His work on this project highlights his thorough knowledge in the subjects of Machine Learning and Deep Leaming. He concentrated all his energies and followed my instructions to the tee while also expressing constructive ideas for improvisation. His ideas are well thought and are clearly articulated which makes him personable and easy to work with. Though he is not outstanding academically, he is a tireless hard worker and has proven himself many a times. His results in his project prove that he is highly passionate in coding and has also proven himself in many coding competitions.
In person, I find him as an intelligent and ambitious young man who is mature beyond his years and have no reservations to give my unqualified recommendation. 1 have the deepest personal and professional respect for him, and sincerely believe that Mr. R. Sai Aniketh will bring his unique energy, optimism, passion, and tireless creativity to your class and university as a whole.
