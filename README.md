 Dr. K. Ram Mohan Rao from the Department of Information Technology - Vasavi College ofEngineering, Hyderabad. I would like to use this letter to recommend one of my students A.Satya Kumar for a place in MSc Computer Science progrnm offered at your University. I have known Satya Kumar for the last three years. He is one of the most promising students I have come across. I have found him to be an intelligent and enthusiastic learner. He is very quick at grasping concepts. Having taught him Distributed Systems & Cloud Computing and Cloud Computing Laboratory, I am fully convinced about his knowledge in the above mentioned subjects.
He has always been a hard worker and I am impressed with his quick perception and reproduction ofconcepts. His application is praiseworthy. His maturity, competence and ability to work diligently indicate that he can perform well even in a highly competitive atmosphere. He has also worked on projects which are commendable.
As per his performance, he is inquisitive to gain knowledge. With his determination and hard work, I have no doubt that he will succeed in all his endeavours. I personally have a strong feeling that Satya Kumar is a deserving personality for M.S. program at your University along with a financial assistance.
I wish him success in his academic pursuits





I take great pride in recommending Mr. Mouli Sanketh Maturi for your prestigious Master's program. In my capacity as an Associate Professor at Vasavi College of Engineering, I have known him for over five years. During this tenure, I have instructed him on Web Technologies, Distributed and Cloud Computing, and Computer Networks during his undergraduate program in Information Technology. I have evaluated his performance in these subjects and supervised his practicalsessions for the same, and I would like to state some of his exemplary skills and accomplishments in the same.
Sanketh is an astute learner who makes every possible effort to complete tasks efficiently while maintaining superior quality. Having said that, he is one of the hardest workersI am aware of and is not easily discouraged in situations that require effort. I observed this during his Distributed and CloudComputing Lab, where he useda more compact and efficient approach to develop an FTP client, connect to an FTP server, and retrieve files, butthe program frequently crashed when multiple files were requested, and Sanketh put in additional hours to get it working. He could easily have accomplished it more conventionally, but his dedication to his task awed me.
Moreover, I have been his mentor for the Smart India Hackathon, a national event in which students from diverse backgrounds come together to propose novel solutions to everyday problems. Sanketh developed a one-of-a-kind solution for estimating the average speed of moving traffic and using this information to dynamically control traffic signals, and thus significantly reducingaveragetransit time. The solution was extremely cost-effective, and his idea was one of the few tobe selected forthe hackathon's level-2 but was subsequently dropped due to a variety of external factors. I believe it is one of the best ideas any of my students have ever come up with, and Icontinue to believe that Sanketh has the potential for an astute researcher. This incident also demonstrated his resilience and organizational abilities; wherein he possesses his innate ability to explain
his viewpoints lucidly to a layman.

 On a closing note, Iwould like to affirm that Sanketh is a dexterous student who faces challenges with verve and vigor and has performed commendably in all his tasks. With
superlative skills ni programming and a capable intellect to apply theoriesto problems, I would not hesitate tostate that he possesses therequired abilities to cope with the demanding curriculum of the program. Iherebywholeheartedly recommend Mouli Sanketh for pursuing his graduate program at your esteemed University and wish him all the best for his future endeavors.








Dear Admission Committee,
I am glad to endorse Mr. Mouli Sanketh Maturi for admission to a Masterâ€™s program at your esteemed university. I have known Sanketh for the past four years, wherein I taught him the theory of Java, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Database Management Systems and also conducted practical sessions for it. Throughout my association with him, I found him to be a sincere and determined person and can confidently assert that he will make for an ideal candidate for the graduate program.
Having taught him a variety of courses, I can confidently assert that he was one of the class's most active participants. He possessed a sound grasp of computer fundamentals, and his enthusiasm for computers was apparent in his coursework. Sanketh initially hesitated during class interactions, but he gradually improved and became the class's best. I vividly recall him associating classroom learnings with real-world scenarios, which helped make the concepts clear to the entire class. To put it succinctly, he rose by lifting others. He is unquestionably in the top 1% of my students, which is an impressive feat given the thousands of students I have taught.
He developed a Customer Complaints Analysis Tool in his third year, which analyzes a data set of complaints across multiple parameters. The project makes use of NumPy and pandas to provide valuable insights such as the products with the most complaints, the average time required to resolve a complaint, and areas for improvement. And, most interestingly, it forecasts the number of complaints that may be received on various days of the week, assisting in the planning of support functions. I believe the project has significant value in real-world scenarios and could have a major impact on a product's success.
    
   Moreover, Sanketh has been successful in developing an all-around personality by being actively involved in many co-curricular activities. He was an active participant in a variety of college initiatives, including TFI (Teach For Ibrahimbagh), where he taught basic coursework to underprivileged children and helped pave the way for their future success. He also encouraged his peers to get involved and exemplify the impact of such initiatives. He was one of the few candidates who was adored by both students and teachers, which speaks volumes about the kind of person he is. It is through these multifarious traits that he was one of the first candidates to be placed in our campus placements.
To summarize, Sanketh has the required sincerity, intelligence, commitment, and drive for the graduate program. He is one of the most brilliant students that I have come across in my career as a professor. I would not hesitate to state that he has demonstrated his competence and passion for the subject through focused and dedicated efforts. I believe that he is well equipped to perform in a rigorous academic environment, and I am confident in strongly recommending him for admission at your acclaimed university. I wish him the best in his future endeavors.
